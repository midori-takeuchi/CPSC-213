5. (description of the test procedure)

To test our implementation, we went through each instruction and used different register numbers to be sure that the simulator was doing what we expected it to do. For example, when we tested the instruction for add, we tested "add r3, r4" and observed that the value at r4 was changed from it's initial value to r4 + r3, which ensured us that our implementation worked.
